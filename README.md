# Stardew-Artisan

Standalone program used for checking prices of artisan goods in Stardew Valley game.


While playing Stardew I was looking for a simple app or website that would tell me which crops are worth putting into Keg/Jar. What I
found where these complicated profit counters which I didn't really need and I felt that they are too cluttered.

Stardew Artisan is a simple program that filters crops by season, puts them in order from the most expensive to the cheapest and even shows
prices of quality artisan goods (wine/pale ale/beer with stars).
You can switch between keg and jar prices while filtering the crops, there's also an option for Artisan Profession which will recalculate
the prices of the crops.

I intend to add more features maybe even prices of crops themselves.




Also don't mind the crappy programming, this whole project started because of me wanting to practice while doing something that feels like something I might use.
Enjoy! :potato:
